Be patient! Hang tight! 🕰️ 

Your Karma points are on the way!  But there are two levels of review before you receive your Karma points. 

 Your points will be allocated within 24 hours ⏳ once they undergo peer review and mentor approval.  It's all about ensuring everything's just right!

So, sit back, relax, and get ready to celebrate your achievements! 🎉
